              Bishnupur is a famous municipality in the Bankura District of West
              Bengal and located at about 132 km from Kolkata. It is famous for
              its terracotta temples and Baluchari sarees. The town has a
              glorious past that is reflected in its rich architecture, music,
              and handicrafts. It prospered in the 17th and early 18th centuries
              under the rule of a line of Hindu Rajas of the Malla dynasty.
              Bishnupur developed a unique form of architecture and has perhaps
              the most brilliant and detailed terracotta work in Eastern India
              that has withstood the ravages of time. The Terracotta tiles
              depict stories from Ramayana and Mahabharata. The Temples like the
              Shyam Ray Temple, the twin shrines of Jorbangla and the Rasmancha
              are a must visit.

              Bishnupur is also known for its traditional handloom sarees,
              pottery, artifacts, and jewellery made of terracotta, and the
              School of Hindustani Music which flourished under royal patronage
              along with the Bishnupur School of Painting. This style of music
              is still being kept alive in local academies of music. The history
              of Bishnupur can be traced back to 694 A.D, when King Raghunath
              founded the Malla dynasty. However, it was much later in 994 A.D
              that the place was named Bishnupur. The name Bishnupur is derived
              from the name of the Hindu God Vishnu. In addition to sightseeing
              and shopping, the classical dance and music festival called
              Bishnupur Mela hosted by the city every year is an experience that
              one should not miss.

              Bishnupur as well as Bengal. The cannon measures about 3.8 m in
